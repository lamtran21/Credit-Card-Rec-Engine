# 💳 Card Matcher: AI-Powered Credit Card Recommender

An end-to-end project that scrapes real credit card data, stores it in a local database, and uses OpenAI’s GPT to recommend cards based on user input. Built with:

- 🔧 FastAPI for the backend API
- 💬 Streamlit for a chatbot-style interface
- 🗃 SQLite for data storage
- 🧠 OpenAI for recommendation logic
- ☁️ Deployed on Render (API) + Streamlit Cloud (frontend)

---

## 🌟 Features

- User enters their credit card preferences (e.g. *"I want a student card with no annual fee"*)
- Streamlit frontend sends input to FastAPI backend
- Backend:
  - Loads all cards from a local SQLite database
  - Sends them along with the user’s needs to OpenAI GPT
  - Returns top 3 card matches with concise reasoning based on bonus offer, rewards, APR, annual fee (last scraped July 2025)
- Frontend displays the results like a chatbot

Create a `.env` file in the root folder:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
```

### 3. Run the backend (FastAPI)

```bash
uvicorn api:app --reload
```

### 4. Run the frontend (Streamlit)

```bash
streamlit run streamlit.py
```

## 📊 Scrapers

To update the card database:

1. Run each scraper inside the `scrapers/` folder (e.g. `scraper_chase.py`)  
2. Then run `load_to_db.py` to populate `cards.db` with fresh data

---

## 🔐 Environment Variables

- `.env` is used for storing OpenAI key.
- It is **not committed to GitHub** (included in `.gitignore`).

---

## 📌 Deployment

- **Backend** is deployed to Render (`api.py`, `cards.db`, and related files)
- **Frontend** is deployed to Streamlit Cloud (`streamlit.py`)
- Deployment uses:
  - `requirements.txt` for dependencies
  - `runtime.txt` to specify Python version (e.g., `python-3.11`)
